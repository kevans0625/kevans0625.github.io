# Kristin Evans' Portfolio

This is my working portfolio site using HTML and CSS following a set of specifications and a style guide. The purpose of this 

is to showcase a collection of my work as I progress and learn more. 

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here.
